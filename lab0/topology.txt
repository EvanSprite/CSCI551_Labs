# The graph is undirected (i.e. if you set a link from 1 to 2 no need to write 2 to 1).
# Each line is a link between two switches. Each switch id must be an integer.
# The name of this file must be "topology.txt"
# One host is automatically connected to each switch.

# Default topology
# This is a Bus topology with 5 switches
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5

# Topology with loop.
# This is the topology shown in Figure 2 of the assignment.
# Should be used to answer questions.
#1 2
#2 3
#3 4
#4 5
#5 6
#6 1
#7 1
#7 2
#7 3
#7 4
